# Google Cloud Pub/Sub C++ Client Library

<!-- This file is automatically generated by ci/test-readme/generate-readme.sh -->
Cloud Pub/Sub is a fully-managed real-time messaging service that allows you to
send and receive messages between independent applications.

This repository contains the implementation of the Google Cloud Pub/Sub C++
client library.

## Status

This library is under development, it should not be used in production
workloads. We expect to make multiple changes to the API.
Please note that, as is often the case with C++
libraries, we do **not** follow semantic versioning in the Cloud C++ client
libraries. We make every effort to document backwards-incompatible API changes
in the [release notes](README.md#release-notes) below.

## Versioning

Please note that the Google Cloud C++ client libraries do **not** follow
[Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

**GA**: Libraries defined at a GA quality level are expected to be stable and
any backwards-incompatible changes will be noted in the documentation. Major
changes to the API will signaled by changing major version number
(e.g. 1.x.y -> 2.0.0).

**Beta**: Libraries defined at a Beta quality level are expected to be mostly
stable and we're working towards their release candidate. We will address issues
and requests with a higher priority.

**Alpha**: Libraries defined at an Alpha quality level are still a
work-in-progress and are more likely to get backwards-incompatible updates.
Additionally, it's possible for Alpha libraries to get deprecated and deleted
before ever being promoted to Beta or GA.
